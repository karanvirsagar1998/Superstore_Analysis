📊 Superstore Sales Data Analysis
This project analyzes a Superstore Sales dataset from Kaggle, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful business insights.

🛠️ Steps Taken
1️⃣ Data Cleaning
Converted short dates (MM/DD/YY) to full date format (e.g., January 25, 2025).
Standardized sales figures to whole numbers (removing decimal points).
Formatted the discount column to display percentages (%).
Applied conditional formatting in Excel to highlight:
🚨 Low sales: Products with fewer than 10 units sold.
📉 Negative profit: Products causing losses.
2️⃣ Data Analysis
Created Pivot Tables for:
Best-selling products
Products with high/low profitability
Identified key trends and made remarks for better understanding.
3️⃣ Data Visualization
Designed two interactive line charts 📊 with filters to analyze sales trends effectively.
